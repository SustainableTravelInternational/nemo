# 🐠 What is NEMO?

Every year, over 16 million people visit the Mesoamerican Reef, putting pressure on this haven of biodiversity. But, what if these same visitors could be a force to save it?

NEMO is a different kind of conservation movement, powered by a community of travelers and adventurers who are actively protecting the Mesoamerican Reef. Whether you’re out diving, snorkeling, or just relaxing on the beach, YOU can become a Natural Environment Marine Observer (NEMO) and help save the reef.
